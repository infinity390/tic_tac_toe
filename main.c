COMPONENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEDs - 12
Arduino UNO R3 (CLONE) - 1
General Purpose Printed Circuit Board - 1
Lithium battery 8v - 1
Resistors (150 ohms) - 12
Button - 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each LED is connected to a resistor of 150 ohms (except D9 and D12)
The input LEDs are connected from digital pin 2-10
The red LED is connected to 11th digital pin
The white LED is connected to 12th digital pin
The green LED is connected to 13th digital pin
The button's one end is connected to ground and other end to analog 0
Ground is common
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO OPERATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Normally press buttons to switch between LEDs (moves/options)
* Long press for enter
* Two mode exist multi player and single player with computer
* For playing with the computer long press on 1st (play first) or 2nd (make
  the computer play first) LED or else long press on 3rd for multi player
* Computer moves, LED will blink and for user played moves LED will remain
  still
* In multi player the player playing first will have his LED still and the
  LED of the other player will be blinking
* Switch between moves by normal pressing and for entering move do a long press
* If the game is draw white LED glows or else red (user can't win) during single
  player but during multi player, if the one playing first wins the green LED
  will glow else red LED will glow if the other player wins and also if a draw
  happens white LED will glow

DEVELOPMENT HISTORY
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial developments (Till build 47)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Build an interface to make user input something
* AI plays random move
* Added feature of letting the user choose for playing first or last
* Fixed bugs like overwriting of moves and skipping of moves
* Check if the game has ended by representing each square as a prime number,
  if the product of any three squares were matched by the database number
  (I had mentioned) then match() return a number
* Used simple loops for match() (game checking)
* Stopped making the AI foolish move, at least AI would not lose until a
  double attack
* Fixed bugs in it
* Added a small database to play center whenever possible
* Added a feature to make the user choose if he wants to include the
  database or not
* Added feature to play double attacks (not to defend)
* Added a feature so if user is doing last and computer will always play a
  corner and a function to make the user lose if user does not play in center
* Added moves to the database which the function cannot catch (in the corner)
* Extended the database for center
* Extended the database for side
* Made the database a bit more bigger so that AI never loses
* Fixed some final bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medial developments (Till build 74)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Used returns instead of goto(s) to come of the function
* Made the chance variable local
* Re-written the whole code in loops and used arrays
* Removed many global variables and used address arithmetic instead
* Removed the function of corner and converted the whole in database
* Re-written the board rotating function according to some arithmetic as it was
  following some pattern
* Make the user prevent to do double attacks
* Made all functions return an address (in declaration) instead of integer
  because program was crashing and it was illegal in c++
* Changed the order of functions so also valid in c++
* Removed useless moves from the database
* Improved the random move playing function and fixed one critical bug in it
* Re-written the names of the function
* Made a non-used variable declaration removed
* Changed the main computer move playing function (which called other functions)
  to return a void, I returned 0 to exit a function so it was declared to return
  an integer, instead I made it return a void for the sake of exiting from the
  function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final developments (Till build 116)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Removed address arithmetic due to crashes
* Made isGameOver() better
* Added gameHandler()
* Added macro functions
* Added preprocessing so that native code and controller code can be switched
* Removed bugs in doubleAttack_forcePrevent()
* Used digitalRead() instead of analogRead() to read analog pins
* Made the program faster by involving functions only when certain moves are
  played
* Removed a bug in database()
* Changed the code according to the new input system
* Moved once called functions to caller functions
* Made one line repeated code a function macro for readability
* Defined USER, COMPUTER, EMPTY, START, HIGHER, ATTACK and DOUBLE_ATTACK for
  readability
* Moved EMPTY, START and HIGHER, as they are not required when native code
  is to be compiled
* Fixed input bug
* Made the code non-repeating in userInput()
* Fixed the order of function so also valid in c++
* Removed macro call from playUser() so valid in all compilers
* Used +3.3V instead of +5V for input
* Used ground instead of +3.3V for input
* Removed the warning returned by clang, added parentheses around
  doubleAttackMoves[1] && doubleAttackMoves[1] == attackMoves[0]
* Turn off the LED after user chose when he/she would be playing
* Did pre-incrementation instead of post-incrementation wherever possible
* Removed isEmpty() and improved database() to make it faster
* Introduced a better database system
* Added trickier moves to the database
* Made the database faster by making it know how many moves are played
* Removed function/macro returnCorner()
* Updated critical move 2, 7; 3; 9: 9 -> 5 in database
* Added critical move 2; 5; 1 in database
* Added move 1; 5; 9 in database
* Added bit boards
* Fixed match()
* Made match() faster by introducing a local not board
* Made macro isLegal faster
* Made macro isIllegal faster
* Made macros playMove and undoMove faster
* Made attack() independent of match()
* Made attack() faster by using bitwise techniques
* Fixed attack() bug by changing the checking of power of 2 from decrementing
  technique to incrementing technique as it can handle 0 too
* Made attack() more fast by introducing a second not board
* Introduced local not boards everywhere for speed
* Rather than incrementing, the numbers shifted and so changed the system
  of communication to playComputer() for speed
* Removed isLegal, isIllegal, isOdd, playMove and undoMove macros
* Made playComputer() more fast by using bitwise techniques
* Made draw checking faster by using or between the two bit boards and check
  if the value is 511 or not
* Fixed critical bug, changed all for(i=1; i<256; i<<=1) to
  for (i=1; i<512; i<<=1) as earlier one does not check the last node
* Added move 5; 1; 9
* Made database communication with playComputer() advanced
* Featured loops in attack() for line values, gains speed in -O3 and made the
  code less repeating but lost speed in other levels of optimizations
* Removed global variables and used address arithmetic instead but bit speed
  loss for lower optimizations (except for database() where instead speed was
  gained) and speed gain for higher optimizations
* Fixed address arithmetic for micro-controller
* Prevent the database to know how many moves are played
* Fixed critical move replies in database
* Reversed normal loops
* Reversed bit shifting loops
* Fixed critical bug in database introduced due to reversing of loops
* Added multi player
* Removed critical bugs in multi player
* Made the blinking pattern changeable
* Code simplification

  The column USER defines the moves which user plays
  The column COMPUTER defines the moves which computer plays
  The column MOVE defines the respond moves
  The column DESCRIPTION defines why the move is played -
  There; PL, FW, and UC mean -
  PL - Prevent losing
  FW - Force win
  UC - Uncritical move
  If a move is defined as a PL move means if computer had played a random it
  may lose, there may be other good moves but this one may lead to the user
  lose as after playing this move there might be only few places where user
  cannot lose.
  If a move is defined as a FW move means if computer had played that move,
  user would lose that game anyway.
  If a move is defined as a UC move means if computer had played that move,
  there might be only few places where user cannot lose, nevertheless even
  if computer had played a random move and if a perfect game is played by
  the user would have lead to a draw.

  Example (the last row in database) (computer is 'O') -
  -|X|O    -|X|O
  -|-|- -> -|O|-
  X|-|-    X|-|-
  Prevents a lose as 1, 4 and 6 may lead to a lose, where 6 is undetectable
  by other functions i.e. attack(), doubleAttack() and
  doubleAttack_forcePrevent()

  The database works in following steps -
  * Initialize variables, data_cases[] and data_moves[]
  * Convert current (binary) board to ternary format then to decimal format
  * Set the variables for how many and which moves to search according to
    the number of moves played
  * Search the database, if any the decimal value of the board matches with a
    value in database, return data_moves[position]; as the position of reply
    moves and position of boards in data_cases[] are same

  The values in data_cases[] are generated with the same algorithm which is
  used by database() to convert the boards to decimals format

  Converting boards to decimal format -
  A board in this program is 1 dimensional similar to this -
  int board[2] = {0, 0};
  where the 0th position is of USER and the 1st position is of COMPUTER.
  The first step is to convert the binary board to ternary, which done like this;
  we know a fact that the bit boards of USER and COMPUTER never intersects, so each
  position is interpreted as; if computer played a move it is interpreted as - 2,
  if user played a move it is interpreted as - 1 or else if no move is played we
  call it as 0. Example -
  {0b010000110, 0b001010001} =
  {0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2}
  Then it is converted to decimal (here ^ means to the power not xor)-
  (As ternary has base 3, every number has to be multiplied by powers of 3)
  0 x 3^8 + 1 x 3^7 + 2 x 3^6 + 0 x 3^5 + 2 x 3^4 + 0 x 3^3 + 1 x 3^2 + 1 x 3^1
  + 2 x 3^0
  (Power of 3 increases as place value increases)
  = 3821
  If the board will be rotated the values will become -
  15013 -> 16221 -> 7013 -> 3821

  Here rotation is defined as (computer is 'O')(anti-clockwise) -
  3821     15013    16221    7013
  -|X|O    O|-|O    O|X|X    X|-|-
  -|O|- -> X|O|X -> -|O|- -> X|O|X
  X|X|O    -|-|X    O|X|-    O|-|O

**********************           AUTHOR NOTES            ***********************
********************** ================================= ***********************
This whole document/code written by me, (name removed) but that does not prove
that either I had made this project alone or someone helped me in it. This code
is not copied from anywhere or taken help from someone else, reference and rules
of C language might be taken from ANSI C Third Edition (BOOK). Previously, I was
going to make this document in MS-WORD or similar word editors, but now I had
included the notes with the code. This is the 116th build made starting from
the 1st build and might have more in future. I used no debugger for debugging
the code. The previously used DEV C++ for compiling and writing the code but due
to its instability and bugs I switched to Code::Blocks. For compiling code for
arduino I used its software arduino itself for compiling the code. A third
party software syntax highlighting was used for printing and highlighting the
document. This software does not use advanced algorithms like negamax, minimax,
etc. I did not implanted due to have the viewers a feel that this is a legit
project and also I could not create a stable and a reasonable version of the
same. This one of the big projects I made and me actually coding this thing
from when I started learning to code, an year ago. This made me make 3 sections
in the development history. This is not much of a perfect good code but somehow
it is bit respectful. This program is FAR FASTER than better programs which use
things like alpha-beta or negascout due the better programs are bit less
'artificially intelligent' than this one due to it simply searches all possible
moves in the game. Some programs might use brilliant techniques to avoid
searching of many nodes (like alpha-beta) but still this program is more of an
AI and plays more like humans does. Algorithms like these may search up to
5000+ game possibilities, better ones may reduce them to 1000s or may be less
than that, but this one will search FAR LESSER nodes; maximum 52 nodes, in
normal cases less than 13 and for some good double attacks less than 49 nodes.
It even searches 0 nodes or search the database for initial phase of the game.
I have seen programs searching the whole game tree at 0 moves played too,
because their programs know nothing more than the rules of the game. This one
is a bit experienced one who knows all the traps already. The database which
makes it real good is updated now, for speed and stability but the new
database does not understand symmetry but the old one did. The new one has
already all the symmetry calculated whereas the old one had to do. The
database uses several tricks so that it becomes fast (;) maths helped me). I
made it really much more faster in compared to the older version of the
database, I did not made it more fast as I did not wanted to consume all the
temporary memory, just the sake of making it faster by couple of trillionth
or billionth of a second. Then the greatest improvement which I made is
adding the bit boards. Computers store every number in the form of binaries,
so it can faster understand it rather than seeing different chunks of memory
for the board. We humans can pretty understand well the binaries in the form
of the numbers in base 10 which are the decimals numbers which we use in our
daily lives. But when something is like this; 2 numbers - 16 and 1, in my
software this means that computer played the first corner and user played the
middle and it the chance of the computer now. Still it is not much complex if
16 and 1 are converted to binary and reversed then we can clearly understand
the meaning of the computer; 000010000, 100000000, where user is the first
one (5th bit is one so user played the 5th block) and in the second one the
first bit is on so computer played the first move. But these kind of logic
makes the computation of the resultant moves faster. My primary goal of the
project was to make it faster and the secondary goal was to make it readable
and it should play similar to how humans play. I did pretty much more than I
excepted but still I feel it could be a bit better.

This software plays human-like I can represent how it plays in some simple
steps-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(If no moves are played)
* PLAY A RANDOM MOVE

(If less than 4 moves are played)
* SEARCH THE DATABASE FOR MOVES

(If more than 2 moves are played)
* TRY TO WIN IN ONE MOVE, IF POSSIBLE
* SEE IF USER IS WINNING IN ONE MOVE; IF YES, THEN PREVENT IT

(If more than 3 moves are played)
* IF POSSIBLE, PLAY A DOUBLE ATTACK

(If more than 2 moves are played)
* IF USER CAN PLAY A DOUBLE ATTACK, PREVENT IT

* PLAY A RANDOM MOVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here, 'PLAY A RANDOM MOVE' at the end and at the last looks same but are not.
The first one is much simpler due to the first one knows that there is nothing
played in the board.

Kindly avoid misunderstanding line breaks in middle of the codes mainly in C++
style comments.

THANK YOU :)
HAVE A NICE DAY...
